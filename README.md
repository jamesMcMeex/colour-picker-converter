# Colour picker-converter website

(This is a work in progress)

This is a simple personal project I started as a way to exercise my ES6/JavaScript knowledge, write some vanilla JavaScript, practise some mathematics in JavaScript.

Everyone's got to write a colour picker website at some point, am I right?!

This very simple website will do a couple of things with colours:
- Pick a colour from a colour picker widget, or
- Take any colour code (HEX, HSL(a) or RGB(a)) into the provided text input
- Display the inputted colour in the background of the site
- Depending on which colour code format was inputted, convert and present the equivalent colour codes

Other features I'm thinking of:
- One click copying of all colour codes presented
- The background should update with the most recently used input (colour picker, or text input)
- The overridden input should reset to a default state
